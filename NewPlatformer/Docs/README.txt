Changes made to the original design:
Level 1: the terminal tutorial was placed at the beginning of the end was placed before it was originally placed
Level 2: bouncing platforms were replaced with solids and terminal was put at the end due to bugs
Level 4: lava block was shortened to jump over it 

Overall, I think that this game was a learning experience. I had to do more work than I most likely should have,
but in the end, I feel like that that was a display of my desire to create large projects. I have dealt with problems
that have made it hard for me to work. 

Ideas for future mechanics:
More blocks
Larger player grid
More weight mechanics
More platforming types
Rotation
